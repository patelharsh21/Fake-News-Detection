# Fake News Detection
## Introduction
Fake news detection is a critical problem in today's digital age, and machine learning techniques have shown promising results in addressing it.Fake news can cause confusion, damage reputations, and even influence political outcomes. 
In this project, we employ logistic regression and decision tree algorithms to detect fake news. We first preprocess the dataset, extract relevant features, and split it into training and testing sets. We compare the accuracy of both models and determine which one performs better in identifying fake news. 
Our aim is to build an efficient and accurate system that can help users identify and avoid fake news.
